# Treasury Direct Mutable Password Userscript
A simple userscript to allow you to log into TreasuryDirect in a sane fashion

## Usage
Using your usercript manager of choice (I recommend [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)), find the dashboard section that allows you to either install from URL or write a new userscript. If installing from URL, use this URL:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scottmconway/Treasury-Direct-Mutable-Password-Userscript/main/treasury_direct_mutable_password.js`

Else, you can copy-paste the userscript into the userscript editor.

That's it! You should now be able to actually type in your password, or auto-fill from a password manager.
